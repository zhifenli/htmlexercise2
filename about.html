        <h2>About</h2>
        <img src="images/single-book.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Founded in 1993, Books n' Beans had its humble beginnings as a resale store for outdated college textbooks.
            As
            its
            cult status in the community grew, so did customer demand for a reliable source of caffeine. Thus, the
            current
            iteration of Books n' Beans was born.

            We're open 7 days a week, offering impeccable coffee, fine pastries, and the most esoteric of publications.

            Stop in for a hot beverageâ€”stick around for lost French translations of Howard Zinn!

            Sincerely,

            Your Friends at Books n' Beans
